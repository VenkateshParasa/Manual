## Study Tips for Success

### Time Management
- Allocate 4-6 hours per day for study
- Take 10-minute breaks every hour
- Review previous day's content before starting new
- Practice exercises immediately after learning

### Learning Strategy
- **Understand, Don't Memorize:** Focus on concepts, not rote learning
- **Practice Actively:** Write test cases, create documents
- **Ask Questions:** Clarify doubts immediately
- **Teach Others:** Explain concepts to solidify understanding
- **Real-World Application:** Think how to apply in actual projects

### Assessment Strategy
- **Quick Mode First:** Test basic understanding
- **Review Mistakes:** Understand why answers are wrong
- **Full Mode:** Comprehensive knowledge validation
- **Time Management:** 1.2 minutes per question
- **Don't Rush:** Read questions carefully

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Confusing Severity with Priority
2. Mixing up Smoke, Sanity, and Regression
3. Not understanding when to use which test design technique
4. Incomplete test case documentation
5. Poor bug report writing
6. Not calculating metrics correctly

## Next Steps

### If You Passed (70%+):
✓ **Congratulations!** You're ready for Week 2
✓ Review any weak areas identified
✓ Complete practical exercises if not done
✓ Take a day to consolidate learning
✓ Start Week 2 with confidence

**Action Items:**
1. Review incorrect answers thoroughly
2. Practice weak areas for 2-3 hours
3. Complete all practical exercises
4. Update your learning journal
5. Prepare for Week 2 topics

### If You Need More Practice (<70%):
⚠ **Don't worry!** Learning takes time

**Action Plan:**
1. Identify topics where you scored <60%
2. Re-read those day's materials
3. Watch supplementary videos/tutorials
4. Practice exercises for those topics
5. Create summary notes
6. Retake assessment after 2-3 days
7. Aim for 80%+ before Week 2

**Focus Areas:**
- If weak in SDLC: Review all models with examples
