## Answer Key

### Quick Mode Answers (Q1-Q15)

**Q1: b) Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**  
Explanation: This is the first value of the Agile Manifesto, emphasizing that people and communication matter more than rigid processes and tools.

**Q2: c) Product Owner**  
Explanation: The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing product value by managing the Product Backlog, prioritizing features, and making trade-off decisions.

**Q3: b) 2-4 weeks**  
Explanation: Scrum recommends sprints of 2-4 weeks duration. This provides a balance between flexibility and planning stability.

**Q4: a) Q1 - Technology facing, guide development**  
Explanation: Unit tests are technology-facing (code level) and guide development (written before/during coding). They belong in Quadrant 1.

**Q5: b) Behavior Driven Development**  
Explanation: BDD (Behavior Driven Development) uses business-readable language to describe system behavior, often with GIVEN-WHEN-THEN format.

**Q6: c) PO, Developer, Tester**  
Explanation: Three Amigos meetings bring together Product Owner (business perspective), Developer (technical perspective), and Tester (quality perspective) to discuss user stories.

**Q7: c) Inspect and adapt the process**  
Explanation: Sprint Retrospective is for the team to reflect on their process and identify improvements. It's about continuous improvement.

**Q8: b) 15 minutes**  
Explanation: Daily Standup is strictly time-boxed to 15 minutes to keep it focused and efficient.

**Q9: False**  
Explanation: In Agile, quality is everyone's responsibility - the whole team approach. Developers, testers, PO, and Scrum Master all contribute to quality.

**Q10: False**  
Explanation: While Agile embraces change, mid-sprint changes should be discussed with the team to assess impact on sprint goal and capacity.

**Q11: True**  
Explanation: Definition of Done is a commitment. If DoD criteria are not met, the story is not complete, regardless of time spent.

**Q12: True**  
Explanation: Exploratory testing is business-facing (user perspective) and critiques the product (evaluates existing features), placing it in Q3.

**Q13: b) Ask clarifying questions and work with PO to refine criteria**  
Explanation: In Agile, clarity is essential. Collaborate with PO to define clear, testable acceptance criteria before committing to the sprint.

**Q14: b) No, it must meet Definition of Done which includes testing**  
Explanation: "Done" means meeting all DoD criteria, which typically includes development, testing, code review, and documentation.

**Q15: d) Q4 - Technology facing, critique product**  
Explanation: Load testing is technology-facing (performance metrics) and critiques the product (evaluates non-functional requirements), placing it in Q4.

### Full Mode Additional Answers (Q16-Q30)

**Q16: b) GIVEN-WHEN-THEN format**  
Explanation: GIVEN-WHEN-THEN (BDD format) is commonly used for acceptance criteria: GIVEN [context] WHEN [action] THEN [outcome].

**Q17: c) Unit Tests**  
Explanation: Test Automation Pyramid recommends 60% unit tests (fast, many), 30% integration tests, 10% UI tests (slow, few).

**Q18: b) Testing earlier in the development lifecycle**  
Explanation: Shift-left means moving testing activities earlier (left on timeline) to find defects sooner when they're cheaper to fix.

**Q19: b) Daily Standup**  
Explanation: Daily Standup is strictly time-boxed to 15 minutes. Other ceremonies have longer durations based on sprint length.

**Q20: b) Functional tests and BDD scenarios**  
Explanation: Q2 (Business facing, guide development) focuses on functional tests, story tests, and BDD scenarios that specify expected behavior.

**Q21: b) Scrum Master**  
Explanation: The Scrum Master facilitates all Scrum ceremonies (Sprint Planning, Daily Standup, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective).

**Q22: a) Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable**  
Explanation: INVEST criteria ensure user stories are well-formed: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable.

**Q23: True**  
Explanation: Second Agile Manifesto value: "Working software over comprehensive documentation." Documentation is important but secondary to working software.

**Q24: False**  
Explanation: Scrum Master does NOT assign tasks. The Development Team is self-organizing and members choose their own tasks.

**Q25: True**  
Explanation: Good acceptance criteria cover both happy paths (positive scenarios) and error cases (negative scenarios) plus edge cases.

**Q26: False**  
Explanation: In the Test Automation Pyramid, UI tests should be only 10%, not 60%. Unit tests should be 60%, integration 30%, UI 10%.

**Q27: c) Discuss with team and PO to decide (remove feature or extend sprint)**  
Explanation: In Scrum, the team decides together. Options include removing the feature from increment, prioritizing the fix, or (rarely) extending sprint.

**Q28: b) Inverted Test Automation Pyramid (Ice Cream Cone anti-pattern)**  
Explanation: This is the Ice Cream Cone anti-pattern - too much slow, brittle UI testing and too few fast unit tests. Should be inverted.

**Q29: b) Product Owner adds it to Product Backlog for prioritization**  
Explanation: New requests go to Product Backlog where PO prioritizes them. They may be included in future sprints based on priority.

**Q30: b) "As a user, I want to reset my password via email, so that I can regain access to my account"**  
Explanation: Correct user story format: "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]." This format focuses on user value.

## Key Concepts Summary

### Agile Manifesto
**Four Core Values:**
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

**Key Principles:**
- Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery
- Welcome changing requirements
- Deliver working software frequently (2-4 weeks)
- Business and development collaboration
- Face-to-face conversation preferred
- Working software is primary measure of progress
- Sustainable development pace
- Technical excellence and good design
- Simplicity - maximize work not done
- Self-organizing teams
- Regular reflection and adjustment

### Scrum Framework

**Three Roles:**
1. **Product Owner:** Maximizes product value, manages backlog, defines acceptance criteria
2. **Scrum Master:** Facilitates ceremonies, removes impediments, coaches team
3. **Development Team:** Self-organizing, cross-functional, delivers increment (includes testers)

**Five Events:**
1. **Sprint:** 2-4 week time-box for development
2. **Sprint Planning:** Plan work for sprint (2-4 hours)
3. **Daily Standup:** 15-minute daily sync
4. **Sprint Review:** Demonstrate increment (1-2 hours)
5. **Sprint Retrospective:** Process improvement (1-1.5 hours)

**Three Artifacts:**
1. **Product Backlog:** Prioritized list of features
2. **Sprint Backlog:** Work selected for current sprint
3. **Increment:** Potentially shippable product

### Agile Testing Quadrants

**Q1: Technology Facing, Guide Development**
- Unit tests, component tests, API tests
- Written by developers (with tester guidance)
- Highly automated, fast execution
- Prevent defects through TDD

**Q2: Business Facing, Guide Development**
- Functional tests, BDD scenarios, story tests
- Written by testers and business analysts
- Mostly automated
- Specify expected behavior

**Q3: Business Facing, Critique Product**
- Exploratory testing, usability testing, UAT
- Performed by testers and users
- Mostly manual
- Find unexpected issues

**Q4: Technology Facing, Critique Product**
- Performance, load, security, scalability testing
- Performed by testers and specialists
- Automated with tools
- Validate non-functional requirements

### User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

**User Story Format:**
```
As a [role],
I want [feature],
So that [benefit].
```

**INVEST Criteria:**
- **I**ndependent - Can be developed in any order
- **N**egotiable - Details can be discussed
- **V**aluable - Provides value to users/business
- **E**stimable - Team can estimate effort
- **S**mall - Can be completed in one sprint
- **T**estable - Can verify if done correctly

**Acceptance Criteria Format (GIVEN-WHEN-THEN):**
```
GIVEN [initial context]
WHEN [event occurs]
THEN [expected outcome]
```

### Definition of Done (DoD)

**Story-Level DoD:**
- All acceptance criteria met
- Code written and reviewed
- Unit tests passed (>80% coverage)
- Functional testing passed
- No critical defects
- Documentation updated
- PO accepted

**Sprint-Level DoD:**
- All stories meet story-level DoD
- Sprint goal achieved
- Regression suite passed
- Potentially shippable increment

**Release-Level DoD:**
- All sprint-level DoD met
- UAT completed
- Production deployment plan ready
- Support team trained

### Test Automation Pyramid

```
         UI (10%)
        ┌────────┐
        │ Manual │
      ┌─┴────────┴─┐
      │Integration │ (30%)
    ┌─┴────────────┴─┐
    │   Unit Tests   │ (60%)
    └────────────────┘
```

**Layer Distribution:**
- Unit Tests: 60% (fast, many tests)
- Integration Tests: 30% (medium speed)
- UI Tests: 10% (slow, few tests)

**Anti-Pattern (Ice Cream Cone):**
- Too many UI tests (slow, brittle)
- Too few unit tests (late feedback)
- Inverted pyramid = bad practice

### Agile Testing Principles

1. **Continuous Feedback:** Provide feedback early and often
2. **Test Early, Test Often:** Testing throughout sprint
3. **Shift-Left Testing:** Move testing earlier in lifecycle
4. **Whole Team Quality:** Everyone responsible for quality
5. **Test Automation:** Follow pyramid, automate appropriately
6. **Collaboration:** Three Amigos, pair testing
7. **Adapt to Change:** Embrace changing requirements

## Practical Application

### Three Amigos Meeting Example

**User Story:** "As a user, I want to reset my password"

**Product Owner Perspective:**
- Business need: Users forget passwords frequently
- Success criteria: <1 minute to reset
- Security: Email-based reset

**Developer Perspective:**
- Implementation: Token-based reset link
- Concerns: Token expiration time?
- Dependencies: Email service

**Tester Perspective:**
- Test scenarios: Valid email, invalid email, expired token, already used token
- Edge cases: Email not delivered, special characters, concurrent resets
- Security: Token strength, brute force protection

**Outcome:**
- Refined acceptance criteria
- Identified 10 test scenarios
- Technical approach agreed
- Ready for sprint

### Writing Effective Acceptance Criteria

**Poor Example:**
❌ "Password reset should work"
- Too vague, not testable

**Good Example:**
✓ **Scenario 1: Valid Email Submitted**
```
GIVEN I am on the password reset page
WHEN I enter my registered email
AND I click "Send Reset Link"
THEN I should receive a reset email within 2 minutes
AND I should see confirmation message
AND the reset link should be valid for 1 hour
```

✓ **Scenario 2: Invalid Email Submitted**
```
GIVEN I am on the password reset page
WHEN I enter an unregistered email
AND I click "Send Reset Link"
THEN I should see "If email exists, reset link sent"
(Security: Don't reveal if email is registered)
```

### Sprint Testing Strategy

**Week 1 (Days 1-5):**
- Day 1-2: Sprint Planning, Three Amigos meetings
- Day 3-5: Test as features are developed
  - Q1: Review unit tests
  - Q2: Write/automate acceptance tests
  - Q3: Begin exploratory testing
  - Q4: Plan performance/security tests

**Week 2 (Days 6-10):**
- Day 6-8: Continue testing, automation
- Day 9: Stabilization, regression, Q3 exploratory
- Day 10: Sprint Review, Retrospective

### Daily Standup Example (Tester)

**Yesterday:**
- Tested user registration story
- Found 2 bugs, both fixed by Sarah
- Started automation for login tests

**Today:**
- Complete login automation
- Test password reset story
- Pair with John on payment integration

**Impediments:**
- Test environment was down for 2 hours yesterday
- Need test credit cards for payment testing

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Treating testers as separate from development team**
✓ Testers are integral team members, not a separate phase

❌ **Testing only at the end of sprint**
✓ Test continuously throughout sprint (shift-left)

❌ **Accepting vague acceptance criteria**
✓ Clarify and refine criteria before sprint starts

❌ **Skipping Definition of Done**
✓ Define and adhere to DoD at all levels

❌ **Not participating in all ceremonies**
✓ Testers should attend all Scrum events

❌ **Focusing only on Q2 (functional) testing**
✓ Balance testing across all four quadrants

❌ **Inverted test automation pyramid**
✓ Follow proper pyramid: 60% unit, 30% integration, 10% UI

❌ **Resisting change mid-sprint**
✓ Embrace change but discuss impact with team

❌ **Blaming individuals for defects**
✓ Whole team owns quality, no blame culture

❌ **Writing user stories from technical perspective**
✓ Focus on user value and business benefit
