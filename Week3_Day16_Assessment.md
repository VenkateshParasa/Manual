## Answer Key

### Quick Mode Answers (Q1-Q15)

**Q1: b) Three-Point Estimation (PERT)**
Explanation: Three-Point Estimation uses three estimates (O, M, P) to account for uncertainty in estimation.

**Q2: c) E = (O + 4M + P) / 6**
Explanation: This is the PERT formula where Expected Time = (Optimistic + 4×Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6.

**Q3: c) >90%**
Explanation: DRE >90% is considered good, >95% is excellent. This means catching most defects before release.

**Q4: b) (Total Defects / Lines of Code) × 1000**
Explanation: Defect Density normalizes defects per 1000 LOC for comparison across projects.

**Q5: c) 40% of development effort**
Explanation: In traditional Waterfall, testing typically consumes 40% of development effort (Agile: 30%).

**Q6: b) Mean Time To Detect**
Explanation: MTTD measures the average time from code commit to defect detection.

**Q7: b) 1-5 defects**
Explanation: Industry benchmark: Good = 1-5 defects/1000 LOC, Average = 5-10, Poor = >10.

**Q8: c) Defect Removal Efficiency**
Explanation: DRE = (Defects Found Before Release / Total Defects) × 100%. Measures test effectiveness.

**Q9: b) 90%**
Explanation: Coverage = (180/200) × 100% = 90%

**Q10: c) 93%**
Explanation: Pass Rate = (465/500) × 100% = 93%

**Q11: b) 3.0**
Explanation: Defect Density = (120/40,000) × 1000 = 3.0 defects per 1000 LOC

**Q12: c) 95%**
Explanation: Total Defects = 95 + 5 = 100. DRE = (95/100) × 100% = 95%

**Q13: c) Combination of WBS and Three-Point Estimation**
Explanation: When you have no historical data, combine WBS (break down work) with Three-Point Estimation (handle uncertainty). Add 20-30% buffer.

**Q14: b) 25% of defects are escaping to production**
Explanation: DRE of 75% means only 75% caught before release, so 25% escape. This indicates testing effectiveness needs improvement.

**Q15: c) Focus on actionable metrics that drive decisions**
Explanation: Include only metrics that help make decisions, show trends, and are actionable. Tailor to audience needs.

### Full Mode Additional Answers (Q16-Q30)

**Q16: c) Major modules**
Explanation: WBS Level 0 is Project, Level 1 is Major Modules, Level 2 is Features, Level 3 is Test Activities.

**Q17: b) External Inputs**
Explanation: In FPA, EI = External Inputs (user inputs data). Other types: EO (outputs), EQ (inquiries), ILF (internal files), EIF (external files).

**Q18: d) 80-90%**
Explanation: Good code coverage target is 80-90%. Minimum acceptable is 70%.

**Q19: c) Behind schedule**
Explanation: SV = Actual - Planned. Positive SV means behind schedule, Negative SV means ahead of schedule.

**Q20: b) Daily Test Status Report**
Explanation: Daily reports track progress, defects, blockers. Weekly = summary, Completion = final report.

**Q21: a) <5%**
Explanation: Defect Leakage should be <5%. This means <5% of defects escape to production.

**Q22: b) Pessimistic time**
Explanation: P = Pessimistic (worst case), M = Most Likely (realistic), O = Optimistic (best case).

**Q23: c) 26.67 hours**
Explanation: E = (15 + 4×25 + 40) / 6 = (15 + 100 + 40) / 6 = 155/6 = 25.83 ≈ 26.67 hours

**Q24: b) 6%**
Explanation: Defect Leakage = (9/150) × 100% = 6%

**Q25: c) 80%**
Explanation: Savings = $45,000 - $25,000 = $20,000. ROI = ($20,000/$25,000) × 100% = 80%

**Q26: b) 5 hours**
Explanation: MTTR = 200 hours / 40 defects = 5 hours per defect

**Q27: b) Escalate immediately and investigate quality degradation**
Explanation: Declining pass rate indicates quality issues. Actions: halt new testing, meet with dev team, review recent changes, implement code freeze if needed.

**Q28: b) Code quality, requirements clarity, and development practices**
Explanation: High defect density (8 vs 3-5 industry avg) indicates issues in code quality, requirements, or team experience. Investigate thoroughly.

**Q29: c) 800 hours**
Explanation: Testing Effort = 2000 × 0.40 = 800 hours (using 40% ratio)

**Q30: b) Test Automation ROI with payback period**
Explanation: ROI with financial metrics (savings, payback period, 3-year projection) is most convincing to management.

## Practical Application

### Estimation Example

**Scenario:** Estimate testing for Shopping Cart module

**Using Three-Point Estimation:**
```
Test Execution:
Optimistic (O): 12 hours (no bugs)
Most Likely (M): 18 hours (few bugs)
Pessimistic (P): 30 hours (many bugs)

Expected Time:
E = (12 + 4×18 + 30) / 6
E = (12 + 72 + 30) / 6
E = 114 / 6 = 19 hours

Standard Deviation:
SD = (30 - 12) / 6 = 3 hours

Result: 19 hours ± 3 hours
Range: 16-22 hours (68% confidence)
```
